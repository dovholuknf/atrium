## Pluggable event sink: get the audit trail out of the primary database

**Raised 2026-09-18.** Not started.

### The problem

Every card keeps a full event history in the SQLite `event` table: `created`, `submitted`, `prompted`,
`perm-requested`, `perm-decided`, `status-changed`, `output`, `notified`, `launched`, `exited`, `compacted`.
`output` events carry chunks of terminal text. Across a long-lived board this is most of the database: a 94-card
board sat at ~40 MB, and almost none of that is the cards themselves.

A database is the wrong home for this. It is append-only, high volume, write-once, and read rarely. It is cold
audit data sharing a file with the hot operational state the board needs on every request, so the thing that
must stay small and fast is dragged down by the thing that only matters months later. What this data wants is a
log that rolls and can be shipped to long-term durable storage an operator chooses, then dropped locally.

### The seam that already exists

Two methods in `internal/store/tasks.go` are the whole surface:

- `AppendEvent(taskID, kind, payload)` writes one event.
- `Events(taskID, limit)` reads a card's recent events back, for the detail dialog and for anything deriving
  state from history.

Everything that logs an event goes through the first. Everything that reads history goes through the second.
A sink abstraction wraps exactly these two.

### The design

**An `EventSink` interface, and the store's table becomes one implementation of it.**

```
type EventSink interface {
    Append(taskID string, e Event) error
    Recent(taskID string, limit int) ([]Event, error)  // may be unsupported; see the split
}
```

**The hot/cold split is the crux.** Two different questions hide in the event log:

- HOT: "what are this card's last N events", which the board asks on every card open. Needs fast, indexed,
  local reads. Small and bounded.
- COLD: "everything that ever happened, kept forever somewhere durable", which nothing on the board reads. Big,
  write-once, ship-and-forget.

So sinks compose rather than one replacing the other:

- A **hot sink** serves `Recent`. Bounded: the last N events per card, or the last few days, in SQLite (or a
  small ring). This is what keeps the primary database small: it holds a window, not all of history.
- One or more **cold sinks** are write-only durability and do not serve `Recent`. They roll and ship.

### The sink options to build

1. **`db` (default).** What exists today, but bounded to a hot window so it stops growing without limit. Nothing
   changes for anyone who does not opt in.
2. **`file`.** Append JSONL, one line per event, rolled by size and by day, under a logs directory. A reader
   tails the current files to serve `Recent` when the db window is not the hot sink. Files roll so an operator
   can move a closed file off the machine and delete it.
3. **`offsite` (S3 / object store, or an event-stream endpoint).** Write-only, asynchronous, batched, best
   effort. Does not serve `Recent`. A plugin boundary here: S3 first, but the shape (open a batch, flush, close)
   is the same for an HTTP webhook, a Kafka topic, or whatever a data lake ingests. Atrium holds the NAME of a
   command or endpoint that has a credential and never the credential itself, the same rule overlays already
   follow.

Composition: `hot=db, cold=[file, s3]` is a real configuration. Reads hit `db`; writes fan out to all three,
cold ones async.

### Resilience, which is not optional here

A cold sink that is slow or down MUST NOT block a hook or a tool call. This is the daemon's existing posture: a
hook must never fail a session, `/activity` is fire-and-forget, storage failure halts rather than degrades.
Cold-sink writes are buffered and flushed on their own goroutine, and under backpressure they drop with a
counted, logged loss rather than stalling the session. The hot sink stays synchronous and on the halt path,
because the board depends on it and a lie there is worse than a stall.

### Configuration

A hub or room setting, `event_sink`, naming the hot sink and the cold sinks, defaulting to `db` alone so a
fresh install and every existing one behave exactly as now. Per the observed-versus-overrides rule, this is an
override a human types; nothing infers it.

### Retention falls out of it

With history in rolling files or shipped offsite, the primary database holds only the hot window, so it stays
small on its own and pruning stops being the only lever. The existing "delete finished cards for good" pruning
still applies to the hot store; the cold trail is retained by whatever policy the file roller or the data lake
enforces, which is where retention belongs.

### Migration and rollout

- Default `db`, bounded window off by default at first so nothing shrinks under anyone without them asking, then
  a follow-up that turns the bound on with a documented default.
- `file` and `offsite` are opt-in.
- No schema break: the `event` table stays; it just stops being unbounded, and stops being the only sink.

### Open questions

- What the hot window is measured in: last N events, last D days, or a size cap per card. Probably a size cap,
  matching how scrollback is already bounded.
- Whether `Recent` must ever read from a cold sink (for a card whose hot window rolled off but which somebody
  opens). Leaning no: the board shows "history rolled off, see the archive at <where>", the same way an offline
  room shows what it last said rather than pretending.
- Whether output events belong in the event log at all, or are a separate stream from the start. They are the
  bulk and the least like an audit event.
